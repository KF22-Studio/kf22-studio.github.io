title: Hello
---

üëã I'm Dominic, a professional software developer, from the heart of Berlin. In my working hours I develop projects as a senior developer in an agency with a focus on current web technologies. In contrast, the projects on this website were created exclusively in my spare time with the help of friends and colleagues. If you have any questions, suggestions or just want to say hello, I'm looking forward to an email from you!
