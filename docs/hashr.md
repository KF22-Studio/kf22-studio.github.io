## Hashr

Hashr is a unique and innovative mobile application that can generate secure, unique and theft-resistant passwords for every website. Using the PwdHash algorithm created by Stanford University, it creates highly secure and strong passwords for all the websites you log into and keeps it safely stored on your mobile device. The password generated by the app will never be stored on a server or somewhere else so you can have peace of mind that all your passwords are safe.
