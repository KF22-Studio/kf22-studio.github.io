# Crystal Miner

In Crystal Miner you have to place crystals in chests in the right order to get coins. What sounds simple at first, becomes more challenging over time. Find your strategy to stay in the game as long as possible, level up and climb the leaderboard.

Crystal Miner is the perfect game for in-between. For all those who like to puzzle and develop strategies to become better. There is no time pressure. If you don't succeed, just start again from the beginning.

- Simple puzzling, without any time pressure.
- Crack your own highscore and compete with friends or people worldwide
- Perfect for in-between, a round takes only a few minutes
- Free to play for life with moderate advertising
- No pay-to-win, no hidden features for money! Every player has the same chances
- We are a small studio with fun in development, not a big company with the intention of profit maximization
